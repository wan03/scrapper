# Scrapper 

 No longer deployed. 

## Description 

This is a project created to keep track of cryptocurrency miners in Alibaba. Alibaba is rendered with JavaScript after the HTML has loaded so I used Puppeteer to get around this issue. It takes the information from Alibaba and stores it in a MySQL database.  

The database is persistent when it updates which allows us to be able to create comments without fear of losing our data.  

This web app was deployed to Google Cloud but since Iâ€™m no longer using it, it has been taken down.  

 

## How to use 

In order to use please clone down the repository and install all the npm packages. Once that is done, run the server.js file using node and go to localhost with the appropriate port.  

## Technologies Used 

Front-end: 
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 

Back-end: 
Node.JS, Express, Sequelize, MySQL, and Puppetter.
